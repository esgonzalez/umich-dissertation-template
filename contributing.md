The easiest way for you to contribute to this template is by submitting a Pull Request. We tend to favor changes that update the thesis-umich.cls file as solutions to problems because it makes it easier for other users in the future and for us to maintain. That said, there are other ways to contribute, too. You can open an Issue, or email us with a suggestion/idea/etc. We'll do our best to find ways to incorporate your suggestions and fixes whenever we can.

Thanks for your interest and help!!

Additional thanks to Derek Dalle for creating the template, his predecessors Jin Ji, Roque D. Oliveira, and Jason Gilbert, and other unnamed folks who started this template off. Many, many graduate students owe you greatly!
